# .gitignore

# Rust/Cargo artifacts
# Ignore the 'target' directory in each individual project
src/*/target/

# Cargo build artifacts for the main workspace (if you ever make it a workspace)
# If you decide to make this a Cargo workspace in the future, you'd also ignore a top-level target/
# target/

# Cargo.lock file for individual projects (optional, but common for applications)
# For a multi-project setup like this, each project will have its own Cargo.lock.
# It's generally recommended to commit Cargo.lock for applications for reproducible builds,
# but for learning, you might choose to ignore it if you want to always build with the latest compatible dependencies.
# If you uncomment the line below, each src/<project>/Cargo.lock will be ignored.
